        <h3>User Interviews</h3>

        <p>I created an interview script that would steer our conversations towards these topics: 
<br>
<br>
          <i>What compels people to participate in digital crowdfunding campaigns? 
            <br>
            Why do people tip street musicians? 
          </i>
          <br><strong>Why:</strong> We needed wrap our minds around why people give money (both online and in-person) to entrepreneurs, musicians and other content creators.  
          <br>
          <br>
          <i>How do people discover new music? </i>
          <br><strong>Why:</strong> Our client wanted us to redesign the app’s “leaderboard,” a screen displaying the most frequently streamed music videos. We needed to investigate how and why music influencers find new tunes. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <i>How do people feel about cryptocurrency? 
          <br> What platforms do people use to send money online?  </i>
          <br><strong>Why:</strong> PurpleThrone has already created its own cryptocurrency: <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x809faaf63ee61b9133102b4fbe560219b534b6e4"> PurpleCoin.</a> Our team needed to determine how comfortable the target demo was with crypto like Ethereum and BitCoin, and whether they might be open to experimenting with the lesser-known PurpleCoin. We also wanted to know what platforms (e.g. Venmo, PayPal) our users were most comfortable with and why. </p>
            <h3>What we learned:</h3>
              <p><strong>Music influencers are insatiable</strong>
              <br>
              Our target demographic finds great satisfaction in discovering and exploring music via apps. Their curiosity motivates them to obsessively click around applications like Spotify — discovering musicians, tracks, playlists and more. This enjoyable feedback loop keeps them engaged. We dubbed this the “Music Influencer Loop.” <br>
              <p><strong>Influencers don’t care about leaderboards</strong>
              <br>
              People who are obsessed with being in-the-know about music (our target demo) don’t look at Top 40 or charting hits — they want to know about artists before they make it big. We presented this insight to our client and he agreed that our design should not include a leaderboard feature. 
              <p><strong>Proof of tipping concept > Cryptocurrency integration</strong>
              <br>
              Our target users weren’t active in the cryptocurrency community and most were not interested in experimenting with a new crypto like PurpleCoin. Our team decided to focus our research efforts and design on integrating a tipping feature that accepts US dollars, and our client agreed that would be the best use of our design sprint. 
            </p>
              <p><strong>Influencers expect algorithm-based, personal music recommendations</strong>
                <br>
                The music apps that influencers are already using often give algorithm-based suggestions. Influencers want and expect this feature. During our contextual inquiries with the PurpleThrone alpha app, we found that users were disappointed when they did not receive personal recommendations after answering survey questions during onboarding.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Emojis viewed as “immature”</strong>
                <br>
                PurpleThrone’s alpha app has users rate their likes and dislikes with poop and fire emojis, respectively. Our research revealed that a majority of the target demographic didn’t like this—and they told us they felt “bad” being negative towards an artist who had put time and effort into their music.

              <p>Based on insights from our user research, we hypothesized that if a user likes a song and favorites it, they will feel as though the artist is good enough to merit a tip.

                <hr style="border-color: #2a0f3c; max-width: 100%">
                <p>Though all users could easily complete tasks, 2 of 4 users were turned off by the word “tip,” and they wanted to know where the money was going. Also, users expressed disgust over the idea that they’d see the tip pop-up screen after each song they liked. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Changing the copy on the tip screen to “back this artist” elicited positive feedback during usability testing of our mid-fi and hi-fi wireframes. We also decided to change the tip format: rather than have the pop-up screen triggers by the user liking a song, the pop-up screen would act like Spotify ad because many of our users are familiar with Spotify. After listening to a few songs, a user would see the tip screen and either have to send a tip right away, or wait 30 seconds before s/he can listen to the next song.

                    <p>For our mid-fidelity wireframes, we created a quick “thank you” screen. Our testing revealed that users liked the screen but wanted a more personal message, and wanted to be notified about getting a receipt. We added a photo of the artist, a “thank you” quote from him/her, and copy telling users that a receipt would be emailed to them.

                    <p>Users had no trouble understanding the onboarding screens we created for our mid-fi usability testing. People loved the lighthearted “Party On” call-to-action button, and they also liked the rocker hand icon. In our mid-fi prototype, we had users select their favorite genres during onboarding and then we designed the homepage to display songs/artists from that genre—users noticed and made positive comments about the personalization.

                      We introduced the “rock” icon when we redesigned PurpleThrone’s onboarding, and our usability testing revealed that the icon was learnable and memorable—many users commented on it as they moved through the app.

        <p>Extending this project beyond the initial design sprint, our team would like to dive into the following:  
          <ul>
            <li><p>Additional testing of hi-fi prototype</p></li>
            <li><p>Cryptocurrency integration
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Calendar feature for users to browse live events with PurpleThrone artists
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Research, design and testing of separate product for artists to manage their presence on PurpleThrone
            </p></li>
          </ul>
